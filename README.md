# Working with Flask

## Overview

This document provides an overview of my practice with Flask and related technologies:

- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for Python used to build web applications.
- **Sessions:** Manage user sessions to store data across requests.
- **Cookies:** Store small pieces of data on the client side and retrieve them in future requests.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight database used for storing data in a file-based format.
- **SQLAlchemy:** An SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Flask to interact with the database.
- **Jinja:** A templating engine used to render dynamic HTML content.

## Key Practices

- **Setup Flask Application:** Configured a basic Flask app with routes and view functions.
- **Session Management:** Implemented sessions to store and retrieve user data.
- **Cookie Handling:** Set and retrieved cookies to maintain user state.
- **Database Integration:** Used SQLite and SQLAlchemy for database operations and ORM.
- **Dynamic Templates:** Utilized Jinja templates to render dynamic content in HTML.

This practice involved integrating these components to build a functional web application with user session management, data persistence, and dynamic content rendering.
